This is a project made using iot devices such as IRs and Arduino. This project aims to deliver a solution to the traffic congestion and inefficient traffic management that exists in India .
We propose a density based system which allots traffic timings based on traffic density and it also has a smart priority algorithm when two or more lanes have traffic.
