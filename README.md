This is a project made using iot devices such as IRs and Arduino. This project aims to deliver a solution to the traffic congestion and inefficient traffic management that exists in India .
We propose a density based system which allots traffic timings based on traffic density and it also has a smart priority algorithm when two or more lanes have traffic.
This system uses density based decision making for traffic ligth management.
This system has built in Ai enabled cctv system which will give alerts containing criminal details , their recent photo and geolocation to concerned authorities when a criminal is detected.
We use face recognition and haarcascade classifiers for this.
Criminal images data needs to be pre loaded in to the system for training.
